Follow the [contribution workflow](#contribution-workflow) for submitting your changes.

## Contribution Workflow
This project uses the “fork-and-pull” development model. Follow these steps if you want to merge your changes into the project:

1. Within your fork of infinite-wish-board, create a branch for your contribution and use a meaningful name.
2. Create your contribution, meeting all contribution quality standards.
3. Create a pull request against the master branch.
4. Before we merge your PR, we may ask you to catch your fork up with what is on master. We are following the merge strategy to [catch up your fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/syncing-a-fork). 
5. Once the pull request is approved, one of the maintainers will merge it and build a release as needed.

## Contribution Quality Standards
Your contribution needs to meet the following standards:

- Separate each logical change into its own commit.
- Add a descriptive message for each commit. Follow commit message best practices.
- If you are resolving an issue, mention the issue # in the commit body.
- Document your pull requests. Include the reasoning behind each change and the testing done.
- To the extent possible, follow existing code and documentation style and practices.
